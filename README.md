# SystemVerilog - Language Support

This package adds language support for Verilog/SystemVerilog. It supports systemverilog syntax, with planned support for signal intelliSense.

- If you find a bug, or would like a feature; Add it as an [Issue](https://github.com/eirikpre/VSCode-SystemVerilog/issues) or a [Pull-Request](https://github.com/eirikpre/VSCode-SystemVerilog/pulls)

## Features
- Syntax Highlighting
- Go to symbol in document
- Go to symbol in workspace folder
- Code snippets for common blocks

## Recommendations
- For `.sv`/`.v` icons, I recommend you to try [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).
- This is not a functional HDL tool that will compile and simulate your code, but this extension will make it easier and more user friendly when writing Verilog/SystemVerilog

## Known Issues
- Go to symbol stops at 50 files (to stay responsive/quick).

## Future
- 100% Complete syntax highlighting
- Tree view of module hierarchy
- References document
- IntelliSense support
- Back-end Language server for Systemverilog

## Release Notes
### 0.2
- Alpha 2 release with expanded syntax highlighting and snippets
### 0.1
- Alpha 1 release with syntax highlighting, and go to symbols
- See changelog for more details
